TextBlob’s output for a **Polarity** task is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0] where -1.0 is a negative polarity and 1.0 is positive. This score can also be equal to 0, which stands for a neutral evaluation of a statement as it doesn’t contain any words from the training set.

Whereas, a **Subjectivity** identification task reports a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is a very objective sentence and 1.0 is very subjective.
